# Summary — Clean Slate

Everything stripped down to minimum. The user will give step-by-step instructions to rebuild each feature.

## What remains

### Frontend
- `features/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` — simple placeholder with `dashboard.empty` translation key
- `features/auth/LoginPage.tsx` — login form
- `features/NotFoundPage.tsx` — 404
- `layouts/MainLayout.tsx` — sidebar only has Dashboard link
- `layouts/AuthLayout.tsx` — auth layout
- `App.tsx` — routes: `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/`, `/404`, catch-all

### Backend
- `modules/auth/` — authentication (login, verify token)
- `middleware/` — authenticate, authorize, errorHandler, rateLimiter, validate
- `config/` — database, env
- `shared/` — logger, etc.

### Database (Prisma)
- Only `User` model (with `Role` enum) remains
- All other models removed from schema
- Database has been `--force-reset` — empty

### Translations
- All keys still in `en.json` / `ar.json` (including unused ones for features to come)

## What was deleted
- All feature modules (patients, appointments, therapists, sessions, assessments, billing, documents, notifications, reports, search, settings, users)
- All Prisma models except User
- audit middleware, checkPatients script
- Dashboard stats cards, appointment list, recent patients, activity feed, categories, reviews
- Commerce features (removed previously)
